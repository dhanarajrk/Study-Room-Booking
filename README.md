## System Architecture

The application is built with a decoupled client-server architecture.

- **Client (React)**: Handles the user interface. Uses Zustand for global state management (authentication, bookings, theme). Axios manages API communication, and Socket.IO handles real-time updates.
- **Server (Express)**: Provides RESTful APIs using Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.
- **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**: Ensures all clients are synchronized without requiring page refreshes.
- **Payment Flow**:
  1. Client sends booking details to the backend.
  2. Backend creates a payment order with Cashfree and returns a `payment_session_id`.
  3. Client uses the Cashfree JS SDK to initiate checkout.
  4. Backend verifies payment status and finalizes the booking.
  5. PDF invoice is generated and sent to the user.
- **Refund & Webhook Flow**:
  1. Upon booking cancellation, backend requests a refund from Cashfree.
  2. Refund status updates are received via webhook and synced to the database.

    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # JWT Authentication
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

    # Email Service (Gmail)
    EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
    EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

    # Cashfree Payment Gateway
    CASHFREE_CLIENT_ID=your_cashfree_client_id
    CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_cashfree_client_secret

    # GoFile API for Invoice Hosting
    GOFILE_API_TOKEN=your_gofile_api_token

    # Application URLs
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
    FRONTEND_URL=your_production_frontend_url
    ```

4. **Seed the database:** (must run manually atleast once - Creates 30 sample tables)
    ```bash
    node seedTables.js
    ```

5. **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Server runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to client directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the client:**
    ```bash
